# Dataset Instructions

This project uses the **Dreaddit stress dataset** (public Reddit posts with stress labels).

## Recommended setup
Place the CSV file here:

`data/raw/dreaddit.csv`

## Alternative setup
If `data/raw/dreaddit.csv` is missing, notebooks/scripts can download the dataset
from KaggleHub (`monishakant/dataset-for-stress-analysis-in-social-media`).

## Notes
- Do not commit raw dataset files to Git.
- Keep only small metadata/split files in `data/` if needed.
- Data is public/anonymized, but still sensitive: handle outputs responsibly.
